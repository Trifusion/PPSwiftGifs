# PPSwiftGifs

PPSwiftGifs provides a convenient way to show animated GIF images as a part of iOS GUI.

## Installation

* Just clone this repo and add ```PPSwiftGifs.swift``` to your project.
* Add ImageIO.framework to your project.
* Add ```#import <ImageIO/ImageIO.h>``` to bridging header.

## Requirements

- iOS 7.0+
- Xcode 6.1

## Usage

```
imageView.image = PPSwiftGifs.animatedImageWithGIFNamed("gif_name")
```

(File named "gif_name.gif" should be present in your project and copied as a bundle resource.
As far as I know, you can't add GIFs to asset catalogs.)

## Author(s)

PPSwiftGifs is written by Peter Prokop but borrows heavily from
